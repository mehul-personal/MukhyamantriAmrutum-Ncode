                                               A list of eligible BPL families is available on online BPL search page on website www.magujarat.com or shall be provided to the manpower provisioning agency. Taluka kiosks are set up at local centers (e.g., Block Health Centers) at each Talukas. These kiosks are equipped by the manpower provisioning agency with the hardware required to collect biometric information (fingerprints) and photographs of the members of the household covered. A printer to print MA cards with a photo is located at each taluka kiosk. The MA card, along with an information pamphlet, describing the scheme and the list of hospitals, will be provided on the spot at each taluka kiosk once the concerned Government Officer has authenticated the BPL beneficiary details. The enrollment process normally takes less than ten minutes at taluka kiosk. The cards shall be handed over in a plastic cover.

                                                MA card is used for activities like identification of the beneficiary through photograph
                                                and fingerprints. The most important function of the MA card is that it enables
                                                cashless transactions at the empanelled hospital and portability of benefits across
                                                the state.

                                                Kiosk itself if the enrollment happened at Taluka Kiosk. However, in the case of
                                                enrolment at mobile kiosk either the beneficiary has to come to respective taluka
                                                kiosk of that particular taluka or will have to wait till another mobile enrollment
                                                kiosk is organized in the same village from where he/she can collect the MA Card.

                                                The photograph of the head of the family on the MA card can be used for identification
